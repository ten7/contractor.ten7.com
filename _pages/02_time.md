- **Where do I track my time?**  
You can track your time wherever works best for you. We ask that you send your time entries with details to our Director of Operations on a weekly basis. 
- **How do I know which projects or tasks I should track time to?**  
Your team lead will let you know which projects, tasks or categories you should be tracking time to. If you have questions about logging your time, ask Dani!
- **Will TEN7 cover my onboarding time?**  
We know that when we start working together it'll take you a little time to get your machine set up with the various tools we use and get up to speed on all our processes. TEN7 is happy to pay you for **up to** a full day (6 hours) of ramp-up time that you can bill to us.
- **Can I bill my local setup and switching time?**  
It's perfectly reasonable for you to log **up to** 3 hours of local setup time when you're working on any new project — whether you're just starting with TEN7 or you've been here a while and you're asked to work on something new. That time should be logged to the client project and is billable to TEN7. This includes things like: pulling a repo, figuring out Flightdeck and Docker, importing a database, getting a vpn set up, compiling themes, and initial codebase discovery. Any additional time spent switching setups locally, troubleshooting or other time is not billable to clients and therefore not billable to TEN7.  
- **How often do I submit my timesheet?**  
Please submit your time entries to Dani at the end of each week. We can’t pay you unless you do. Your time entries will be reviewed on Mondays, at which point that week's time is approved.
- **How often should I invoice?**  
We ask that you invoice us on a monthly basis — on the 1st of every month for all time logged in the previous month. Your invoices should be dated as the last day of the previous month. For example, on 10/1, you will invoice for September, and the date on your invoice should be 9/30. 
- **How do I invoice?**  
Email your invoice to [billing@ten7.com](mailto:billing@ten7.com). No need to itemize things, a total is fine — so long as you've been sending itemized time entries to Dani each week. Make sure each invoice only contains time spent during one month. If you are invoicing for work done in multiple months, please submit them as separate invoices (one for each month's work). 
- **How and when do I get paid?**  
Invoices are net 30. You'll see payment in your bank account via direct deposit through Gusto. Don’t forget, you’re a 1099 contractor, so we **don't** withhold any taxes. You're responsible for applicable taxes in your jurisdiction.
