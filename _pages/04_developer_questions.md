- **Do you have standups? Am I supposed to attend?**  
Standups are scheduled per project at the discretion of the Project Manager. You are expected to attend them if you're assigned to the project. We also ask that you please post your priorities each day in our `#standup` Slack channel.
- **Where is all the code?**  
Most of the code you will work with will be in our own Git server, to which you can get access by asking for it in the `#developers` Slack channel. We have clients that host with Pantheon, Acquia and platform.sh, so each will have their own setup.
- **How do I make changes to code?**  
We use the [git flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching model, and use feature branches extensively. Your code will always be reviewed by another set of eyes before it goes live. And we expect that you will spend time reviewing code from others as well. This is how we all learn!
- **How do I get my code live?**  
Getting your code live is usually a mix of finishing a feature branch, pushing the code into the develop branch, and then doing a release to the main branch. You probably wonâ€™t be responsible for doing releases to main.
