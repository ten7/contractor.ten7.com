- **Do I get any time off? When is TEN7 closed?**  
As a contractor, you won’t get any paid time off. If you need to take time off, we ask that you give us as much notice as possible, so we can plan accordingly. You can reference the [TEN7 Handbook](https://handbook.ten7.com/ourbenefits.html) for specific holiday closures. 
- **Should I attend All Company Meetings?**  
There is no need for you to attend All Company Meetings. We will communicate anything coming out of those meetings that you may need to know as part of your project work.
- **Do I get any TEN7 issued hardware or software?**  
Nope! ← simplest answer
- **Does TEN7 have Brand Guidelines?**  
Why yes, we do! You can find them at [https://t7.io/brandguidelines](https://t7.io/brandguidelines).
- **What is the correct way to write the company name?**  
The rule of thumb is that "TEN7" should always be written in CAPS with NO space between the "TEN" and the number "7". Don’t use lower case, and don’t add spaces. The "TEN7" wordmark is geared to resemble the logo as closely as possible.
